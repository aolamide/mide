        <p>College is expensive! Between tuition, housing, food, and others, many undergraduate students rack up debt that will take years to pay off. But it doesn’t have to be that way! The app focuses on students saving for a long period of time and can only cash out on the day of graduation. This money will be a support or even capital 
            for students who want to start their personal business. This would help students save money even while they are in school. </p>
        <div class="border-y py-16 my-11">
            <h2 class="font-bold text-xl mb-4">Problem</h2>
            <p class="font-light">Without the proper financial understanding and stability, life after college can be difficult. Graduates are left with nothing but peanuts to survive on because they have no source of income to support their hopes and objectives. But it doesn't have to be this this when technology can help.</p>
            <h2 class="mt-12 font-bold text-xl mb-4">Goal</h2>
            <p class="font-light">To create a smartphone application that will assist students in saving money while still in school. Only after graduation may they cash out the money they have saved over a long period of time. It would serve as a source of support or perhaps financing for students who desire to start their own business.</p>

However, after receiving the required responses from users, I proceeded to use the miro tool to analyze the feedback I received, which assisted me in identifying specific problems that users face, a solution to such a problem, and a feature that is appropriate to solve such a problem while designing the app. The research was also beneficial in determining the feature flow, information architecture, and user flow.</p>

            <p>To evaluate this prototype, I conducted a moderated remote usability study with 10 participants spanning across University students from different regions in the 
                country. This was followed by a qualitatitve survey that asked participants to describe their thought process while performing the tasks.

                <li>Prompt for feedback after each task regarding what went well, what did not.</li>
