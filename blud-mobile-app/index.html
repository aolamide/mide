blood supply in Africa.">
    <p>As the supply of blood has been limited in Africa for quite an age, I decided to find solutions to this problem. Blud mobile app can help in bridging the gap of limited blood supply by connecting donors to their nearby blood banks. With thismethod Blood donation will be seamless. </p>
    <div class="border-y py-16 my-11">
        <h2 class="font-bold text-xl mb-4">Problem</h2>
        <p class="font-light">Without the proper enlightenment on Blood donation, its importance and risks, bridging the gap of limited blood supply in africa can be difficult. People are left with
            no hope to live when they need blood transfusion for themselves, their friends and family. But it doesn't have to be this when technology can help.</p>
        <h2 class="mt-12 font-bold text-xl mb-4">Goal</h2>
        <p class="font-light">To create a smartphone application that will assist donors in donating their blood to the blood banks around them, scheduling appointments with the blood banks,
            learning about the importance of blood donation and also incentivizing the donors.</p>

        <p>I focused on the youths because it was more scalable to enlighten the mass about blood donation through them. The youths are at the center of
            the population. It would be more scalable for them to educate the older and younger generation..</p>

I ensured the target audience was people who have experience with blood donation so I could have emphathy with the users and know the problem can be defined.
            Interacting with the leads got me familiar with them, I got to know their pain points, problems and how I can solve them. Here is the link to top answers to questions that were asked;

        <h4 class="text-4xl my-6 font-bold">Evaluation</h4>
        <p>To evaluate this prototype, I conducted a moderated remote usability study with 10 participants spanning across University students from different regions in the
            country. This was followed by a qualitatitve survey that asked participants to describe their thought process while performing the tasks.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-10 mb-6">Here’s a brief of the process;</p>
        <ol class="list-decimal list-inside mt-2">
            <li>Explain the concept behind the app to the users.</li>
            <li>Ask them to perform benchmark tasks one by one.</li>
            <li>Prompt for feedback after each task regarding what went well, what did not.</li>
            <li>Analyse testing findings to find patterns within data.</li>
            <li>Iterate designs based on new insights.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5 class="font-bold text-2xl text-center">Usability Study</h5>
        <p class="my-2">Location : Lagos, Nigeria</p>
        <p class="my-2">Participants: 5  (3 Students and 2 Medical Doctors)</p>
        <p class="my-2">Duration: 5 minutes</p>

        <h6 class="font-bold text-xl my-5">Patterns Identified</h6>
        <ul class="list-inside list-disc">
            <li>It was observed that majority liked the navigation path flow. As It saves their time, It also makes the app mobile friendly.</li>
            <li>It was also observed that Users wanted to be able to cancel their blood requests incase of unintentional mistakes. </li>
            <li>Users also liked the idea of hourly notifications, and the practitioners endorsed it because people tend to forget things a lot.</li>
            <li>Other things users talked about were of personal interests; Dark mode theme, calm colors e.t.c Which would be considered along
                the building process.</li>
        </ul>

        <h6 class="font-bold text-xl my-5">Insights</h6>
        <p class="my-3">After Identifying the suggested patterns by our users , the following insights were achieved for further itineary processes;</p>
        <ul class="list-inside list-disc">
            <li>A cancel option was then added after a user finishes his/her appointment bookings. That will lead them back to the home page.</li>
            <li>A light mode theme was used because of the nature of the sector, being a medical app, interface had to be calm and clean. </li>
            <li>Due to one of the users suggestions, the home page was re-oriented , so users can the breathing space on the page</li>
            <li>A save option for serial numbers was also added, users will get to save their booking details as pictures on their as to not
                forget it.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="my-8 text-sm">We gathered a mostly positive response to the prototype. Participants were able to perform the benchmark tasks with ease, and the survey allowed us to obtain qualitative data about user's thoughts while using the app. Here are a few highlights from the results:</p>

            <li class="mt-4">
                <span class="font-bold">Importance of UX in every project:</span>  Taking the user research, usability study made me realise there’s no good UI without UX.
                A great product is fetched from a brilliant User experience.
            </li>
            <li class="mt-4">
                <span class="font-bold">Enlightenment:</span> Users need to be enlightened and informed of new developments in their surroundings. For example 60%
                of users that were interviewed did not know where to go if they needed to donate or request for blood.
            </li>
            <li class="mt-4">
                <span class="font-bold">Satisfaction:</span>   I feel satisfied and happy that I was able to solve this problem, It was evident in the usability study how the
                users were applauding the project. They felt the change. This mobile application can bridge the gap of limited blood
                supply in Africa.
