        <p>College is expensive! Between tuition, housing, food, and others, many undergraduate students rack up debt that will take years to pay off. But it doesn’t have to be that way! The app focuses on students saving for a long period of time and can only cash out on the day of graduation. This money will be a support or even capital
            for students who want to start their personal business. This would help students save money even while they are in school. </p>
        <div class="border-y py-16 my-11">
            <h2 class="font-bold text-xl mb-4">Problem</h2>
            <p class="font-light">Without the proper financial understanding and stability, life after college can be difficult. Graduates are left with nothing but peanuts to survive on because they have no source of income to support their hopes and objectives. But it doesn't have to be this this when technology can help.</p>
            <h2 class="mt-12 font-bold text-xl mb-4">Goal</h2>
            <p class="font-light">To create a smartphone application that will assist students in saving money while still in school. Only after graduation may they cash out the money they have saved over a long period of time. It would serve as a source of support or perhaps financing for students who desire to start their own business.</p>

            <p class="font-bold mt-5">Focus</p>

            <h4 class="text-2xl my-6">User Interviews</h4>
            <p class="font-light">The user research assisted in learning more about the people who will be using the product. I was able to identify user needs, goals, and behaviors using Google Forms, which influenced my product and design decisions. However, after receiving the required responses from users, I proceeded to use the miro tool to analyze the feedback I received, which assisted me in identifying specific problems that users face, a solution to such a problem, and a feature that is appropriate to solve such a problem while designing the app. The research was also beneficial in determining the feature flow, information architecture, and user flow.</p>
            <p class="my-6 font-light">I gathered a lot of user pain points, demands, goals, emotions, and concerns, but I'll share some of the highlights with you here so you can get a better sense of my design thinking and process journey.</p>

                <p class="my-4">The Onboarding screens introduce the users to the Grind app, It basically summarizes the whole application in  three screens. From the first carousel that tells them
                    ‘Save now, enjoy later’ to showing them that when they save, they get returns in form of interest. And lastly the users see that they can learn how to save. These
                    screens are important because they get the users excited before they actually use the app. They get that excitement to use the Grind app.</p>
                    <p>
                        The other screen is the language screen where the users can pick the language they understand as to use the app better.

                <p class="my-4">The first screen is where users input their university email to verify their student eligibility. This ensures that only university students can create an account with
                    the Grind app. Then they get a four digit code sent to their university email which they use for the verification. Lastly they get to input their personal and contact
                    information which is used to help them create their accounts. </p>
                    <p>
                        Inputting their matriculation number was excluded, I felt that It might intimidate the students as it is a sensitive information.

                    <p>
                        They also get to see their recent transactions on their dashboard. I designed this mobile app in such a way that most of the services the users might need is easily
reachable and accessible from the home screen/ dashboard.
Users can toggle through the navigation bar, from home to plans to cards then finally to their profiles.

                <p class="my-4">When creating a new savings plan, users get to pick between the locked or jaiye savings plan. The locked savings plan disables withdrawal until the funds reaches its
                    maturity date. While the Jaiye savings plan gives the users control over their funds; save and withdraw anytime they want.
                    When detailing the plan, users are asked to name the plan, how often they want to save and when they plan on cashing out their funds. </p>
                    <p>
                        After inputting their preferences, the savings plan details are summarized for the users including the fixed interest rate given by Grind. Then they can confirm the
creation of the plan by clicking the CTA.

            <h4 class="text-2xl my-6 font-bold">Evaluation</h4>
            <p>To evaluate this prototype, I conducted a moderated remote usability study with 10 participants spanning across University students from different regions in the
                country. This was followed by a qualitatitve survey that asked participants to describe their thought process while performing the tasks.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-10 mb-6">Here’s a brief of the process;</p>
            <ol class="list-decimal list-inside mt-2">
                <li>Explain the concept behind the app to the users.</li>
                <li>Ask them to perform benchmark tasks one by one.</li>
                <li>Prompt for feedback after each task regarding what went well, what did not.</li>
                <li>Analyse testing findings to find patterns within data.</li>
                <li>Iterate designs based on new insights.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="mt-8 mb-4">Usability testing can reveal design flaws that would otherwise go unnoticed. When you observe how test users behave while attempting to complete tasks, you will gain critical insights into how well your design/product works. Then, you can use your newfound knowledge to make improvements. The findings of this study are summarized below.</p>

            <p class="my-8">We gathered a mostly positive response to the prototype. Participants were able to perform the benchmark tasks with ease, and the survey allowed us to obtain qualitative data about user's thoughts while using the app. Here are a few highlights from the results:</p>
